MediaEdge WP Theme

Installing the MediaEdge Theme
1. To install the Wordpress MediaEdge theme, upload the the theme zip file to your WordPress install > Admin (yoursite.com/wp-admin) > Themes > Upload. You may also install the theme using FTP by dragging the MediaEdge folder (NOT the zip file) to your themes folder (wp-content/themes).

2. After the theme is installed, activate the theme within the WordPress admin panel, on the “Appearance > Themes” page.

3. Now we need to make the homepage use the proper page to be able to use the themes build in widgets and take full advantage of the tools provided in the theme. To do this simply navigate to (Within WordPress admin panel) "Pages" and create a new page named "Homepage", then choose the template "Homepage" within the "Page Attributes" box on the right side of the page.

4. Finally navigate to (Within WordPress admin panel) "Settings > Reading" and change the "Front page displays" setting to the "A Static page" and then select from the dropdown the page we just created, "Homepage".
